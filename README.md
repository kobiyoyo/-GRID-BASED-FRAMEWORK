## Grid
Each column is contained within rows, which are contained within a container. The container is set to a maximum width of 960px, but you can edit without having to break anything.

## Code
Simply state the number of columns you want your content to occupy in the .col class. For example, if you want your content to take up 8 columns (out of 12), simply give your content the class .col-8.

Simple grid is built mobile-first, so all columns will expand to the full container width on smaller screens. If you don‚Äôt want columns to expand on mobile devices and small screens, simply add -sm to the end of your column class name. For example, if you want to have two blocks of content floating side-by-side on small screens, each would be given the class name .col-6-sm.

Be sure to nest columns within a .row class. You may also choose to nest rows within a .container class.

Offset classes
Move columns to the right using .offset-*-md classes. These classes increase the left margin of a column by * columns. For example, .offset-4-md moves .col-4-md over four columns.
 
Typography
Simple Grid uses Lato from Google Fonts as a base font-family. Font-size is based on root rem units.

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

Additionally, should you choose to style any of the headers or paragraph font-weights, simply add the class .light-font, .regular-font, or .heavy-font to your markup. Paragraph text is set by default to a font-weight of 200. Note: the .font-heavy class should not be used as a replacement for semantic bold body copy.
